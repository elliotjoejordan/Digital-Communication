An encoder-decoder

First, use pip or another python module installer in order to 'pip3 install bitstring'.
To run the Huffman encoder on myfile.txt or any text file, navigate to the appropriate directory and type in console: 'python3 encodeDecode.py encode myfile.txt'. 
To run the decoder, repeat but with 'decode' replacing 'encode' in the command, and run with a .hc file extension: 'python3 encodeDecode.py decode myfile.hc'. 
It is also possible to run both the encoder and decoder one after another, by simply removing the encode or decode commands. This is only possible with an input file extension '.txt'.
